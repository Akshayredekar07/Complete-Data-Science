### Why Containers?  

*Imagine this scenario:* Developer A is working on a data science application on **Windows**, carefully writing code and testing modules to ensure everything works perfectly. Meanwhile, the QA team is tasked with testing the same application on a **Linux** server. Everything seems fine until one day, QA raises a concern: “The modules don’t work on Linux.”  

Developer A is frustrated: _“But it works perfectly on my machine!”_  

Now enters Developer B, who has a slightly different development setup, and to everyone’s dismay, the application behaves inconsistently on their system too.  

This back-and-forth leads to endless debates between the development and QA teams. The root of the problem? **Environment inconsistencies.**

Containers, such as **Docker**, provide a solution to this chaos. They allow you to package your application along with all its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into a single, portable unit. This containerized application will run exactly the same on Windows, Linux, or any other environment where Docker is supported.

By using containers:  
1. Developers can work in a **consistent environment**, regardless of their individual setups.  
2. QA teams can replicate the exact environment used during development, eliminating compatibility issues.  
3. No more arguments about “it works here but not there.”  

In essence, containers ensure that what works on one machine works **everywhere**, fostering better collaboration and efficiency between teams. They shift the focus from fixing environment-based issues to building and testing the application itself.

#### **Containers**

 A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
* Portable artifact, easily share and move this package to any environment
* Makes development and deployment more easy and efficient


### **Containerization**  
#### **Key Concepts with Examples:**  

Imagine House A as the original environment where the application is developed and tested. This house contains everything needed for the application to function, such as the TV, washing machine (WM), and kitchen, which symbolize the dependencies and configurations.

Packaging is the process of creating a container image that bundles the application with all its dependencies. This image is the container, a packaged artifact containing the application and its required environment.

Now, think of House B as a different environment where the containerized application will be deployed, such as a QA server or production. Unpacking is the act of running the container image to extract and execute the application with its dependencies in this new environment.

**Benefits of Containers:**

Containers provide isolation by running in their own environment, separate from the host system, which avoids conflicts with other applications. They offer portability, allowing a containerized application to run consistently across different systems, whether it’s Windows, Linux, or macOS. Additionally, containers enhance efficiency by simplifying deployment and reducing the time spent resolving environment-based issues.

**_Real-World Scenario:_**  

- **Problem:**  
  Developer A creates a Python-based data science application on Windows. The QA team tests it on Linux, and the application fails due to dependency issues.  
- **Solution:**  
  Using containers, the application and its dependencies are packaged together, ensuring it runs identically in both development and QA environments.

### **Docker Image VS Containers**

#### **Docker Image**
- A read-only template that acts as a **blueprint** for creating containers.
- Composed of **multiple layers**, each representing a specific addition or modification.
- Layers are built hierarchically, forming a **layered structure**.
- Example layers in a Docker image:
  - **Linux Base Image**
  - **Anaconda Image**
  - **Python 3.1 Image**
  - **MongoDB Image**
  - **Application Dependencies & Configuration**

#### **Container**
- A **running instance** of a Docker image.
- Created by executing the Docker image.
- Provides a **lightweight, isolated environment** for running applications.
- Shares the layered structure of the image but adds a **writable layer** on top to store data and runtime changes.

#### **Analogy**
- A Docker image is like a **blueprint for a house**, while a container is the **actual house built from that blueprint**.

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Represents the packaged application with all dependencies and configurations.    | Runs the Docker Image to create an isolated environment for the application.         |
| **Purpose**               | Can be moved or shared across different environments.                            | Starts the application within the container environment.                             |
| **State**                 | Static (read-only).                                                              | Dynamic (running instance of the image).                                             |
| **Environment**           | Acts as a blueprint for the container.                                           | Creates an isolated environment for the application to run.                          |
| **Execution**             | Cannot be executed directly.                                                     | Runs and executes the application within the container.                              |

| Smaller (typically MBs).                                                                      | Larger (typically GBs).                                                              |
| Faster startup and runtime.                                                                   | Comparatively slower startup due to the overhead of a full guest OS.                 |
| Contains only the necessary software and libraries for the application to run.                | Requires a full guest operating system.                                              |
| Shares the host machine's kernel, consuming fewer resources (CPU, RAM).                       | Runs a full guest OS, consuming more resources (CPU, RAM).                           |
| Easily portable and runnable on any system that supports the Docker runtime.                  | Generally tied to a specific hypervisor, limiting portability.                       |
| Provides isolation for applications but shares the host's kernel.                             | Offers full isolation with a separate guest operating system.                        |
| May face compatibility issues across different operating systems.                             | Broad compatibility, as VMs can be installed on any OS with a hypervisor.            |
| Suitable for microservices and applications needing portability and resource efficiency.       | Ideal for applications requiring complete isolation and compatibility with legacy software. |

# Install necessary build tools
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev python3-dev libffi-dev

# Copy project files to the container
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

```

--

#### **Flask App (app.py)**
```python
from flask import Flask
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def home():
    return "Hello World"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```


#### **Requirements File (requirements.txt)**
```
flask
pandas
numpy
```

#### **Steps to Build and Run the Docker Image**

#### **1. Create a Docker Image**
Run the following command to build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t flask-app .
```

#### **2. List Docker Images**
Check if the image is built successfully:
```bash
docker images
```

#### **3. Run the Docker Container**
Start a container using the created image:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-app
```
- The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

#### **4. List Running Containers**
View all running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```

#### **5. Stop the Running Container**
Stop a container using its ID or name:
```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```

#### **6. Remove the Container (Optional)**
Delete a stopped container:
```bash
docker rm <container_id_or_name>
```

#### **Testing the Application**
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. You should see the message: `Hello World`.
