### **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** A statistical method used to estimate model parameters by maximizing the likelihood of observing the given data.
* **Probability vs. Likelihood:** Understanding the difference between probability and likelihood is crucial for comprehending MLE.
* **Applications:** MLE is used in various fields, including machine learning, particularly in models like logistic regression.
* **Challenges:** MLE can be challenging to grasp, requiring both mathematical and intuitive understanding.
* **Approach:** A suggested approach to learning MLE is to start with basic concepts and gradually progress to more complex applications.
