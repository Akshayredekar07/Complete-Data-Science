    "1. **Deterministic Experiment** – The outcome is certain and predictable.  \n",
    "   - Example: Boiling water at 100°C (at standard pressure) will always turn into steam.  \n",
    "2. **Random Experiment** – The outcome is not certain and can vary.  \n",

    "We use the formula:  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ P(B|A) = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Multiply for dependent events**  \n",
    "Since drawing the second red ball depends on the first:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B|A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = 0.4 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 0.1333 $$\n",

    "So, the probability that a product is from Machine X given that it passed quality control is **0.57 (57%)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "- We use conditional probability because we know the event \"passed quality control\" happened.  \n",
